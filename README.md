DIY Smart Lock with Arduino and RFID
This is a rfid based smart lock.
Components



    Arduino. We've used an Uno, though any Arduino board or clone will suffice.
    3 x 220 ohm resistors
    1 x 10k ohm resistor
    Logic-level N channel Mosfet
    MFRC522 module with at least two cards/fobs to read. Most come with one of each, and can be bought for less than $2, but you probably already have one in your wallet in the        form of a public travel card.
    Red, blue, and green LEDs
    12v Solenoid ($2)
    12v power supply
    Breadboard and hook up wires
